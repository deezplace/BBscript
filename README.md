Dz Bash Backup Shell script

A linux shell (bash) script to use rsync for backing up my data.

I have a simple menu which allows me to choose which items I want backed up.

It has a toggle to only copy or to delete extraneous files and copy to destination.
It defaults to a DRY RUN mode so you can see what would have been copied/deleted.

All care, no responsibility. Happy for feedback.

Hope it is of some use to others.
