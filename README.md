Dz Bash Backup Shell script

A linux (bash) shell script to use rsync for backing up my data.

Has a simple menu which allows me to choose which items I want backed up.

Toggle between copy only OR copy and delete extraneous files.

Has a DRY RUN mode so you can see what would have been copied/deleted.

All care, no responsibility. Happy for feedback.

Hope it is of some use to others.
